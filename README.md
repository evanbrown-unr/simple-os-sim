# cs446-OpSys

This repository contains the simulation projects for CS 446 at UNR.
There will be four phases, each of which building off of the preceeding phase.
The essence of all of the phases is that a configuration file is read it to set up
the simulator. Then a metadata file is read to set up the PCBs within the OS queues.
After that, the process is ran with all processes\operations being logged to the monitor
and\or a logfile. 

PHASE ONE:
For the first phase, we are implementing an FCFS scheduling algorithm,
as it is the simplest to work with.
